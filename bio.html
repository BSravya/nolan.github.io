		<h2><i>Christopher Edward Nolan</i></h2>
		<h3> Born: July 30, 1970 in London, England, UK </h3>
		<h5>
		Christopher Edward Nolan, born 30 July 1970 is a British-American film director, producer, and screenwriter. <br>
		He is one of the highest-grossing directors in history, and among the most successful and acclaimed filmmakers of the 21st century.<br>

Having made his directorial debut with Following (1998),
 Nolan gained considerable attention for his second feature, Memento (2000),
 for which he received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay.<br>
 The acclaim garnered by his independent films gave Nolan the opportunity to make the big-budget thriller Insomnia (2002) and the mystery drama The Prestige (2006). He found further popular and critical success with The Dark Knight Trilogy (2005â€“2012); Inception (2010), for which he received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Picture and a second Original Screenplay nomination; Interstellar (2014) and Dunkirk (2017). His ten films have grossed over US$4.5 billion worldwide and garnered a total of 26 Oscar nominations and seven wins. 
 Nolan has co-written several of his films with his younger brother, Jonathan, and runs the production company Syncopy Inc. with his wife, Emma Thomas.
<br>
Nolan's films are rooted in philosophical, sociological and ethical concepts, exploring human morality, causality, the construction of time, and the malleable nature of memory and personal identity. His body of work is permeated by materialistic perspectives, labyrinthine plots, nonlinear storytelling, practical special effects, and analogous relationships between visual language and narrative elements
